Problem Definition<br />
Many people are looking to improve their health in a variety of different ways yet struggle to consistently meet healthy standards. They have no way of keeping track of their progress over time and find that they need help to develop these healthy habits and motivate them towards their goals.<br />
Project Objective<br />
To solve that problem we are developing a system which would act as a user’s personal health tracker. It would be capable of keeping track of a user’s daily health habits to monitor if they’re meeting their daily goals and to track their improvement over time.
